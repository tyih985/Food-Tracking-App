# My Personal Project — Meal Tracker

### <u>Project Proposal / Overview</u>

My application will be a **restaurant / food tracker** where users can keep track of the kinds of foods they eat at
different restaurants. They will be able to *log the prices of the dishes they eat*, *keep track of what restaurants
those dishes came from*, and be able to *rate how much they enjoyed each dish*. This project is of interest to me
because I have always been nonchalant when it comes to spending money when eating out. However, due to food cost
inflation in recent years, I recognize that I should be more conscious of my spending habits. With my newfound sense of
independence and responsibility as a post-secondary student, want to use this opportunity to build an application that
will help me achieve my goal of spending more responsibly.

My target audience encompasses others who want to be more mindful of their spending habits when dining out, such as
fellow post-secondary students. By providing users with a platform to log and compare the meals they eat, I want to
create a valuable tool that can help sustain one's financial goals. Whether users are looking to budget more
efficiently, or simply keep track of their favourite restaurant meals, I hope my application proves to be worthwhile.
